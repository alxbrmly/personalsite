            <h1>My Thoughts on Learning Code</h1>

            <p>I have wanted to learn code for a long time and I had been
            looking at code courses for over a year before deciding to take a
            course. It took a lot of thought and decision making to choose what
            course to take and what school to attend. I first needed to decide
            whether I would keep my full-time job or quit and take a full-time
            intensive course. I quickly realized I needed money, there were
            401ks to fill, and course bills to pay after moving out of my
            house.</p>

            <p>I was familiar with code through using livejournal and blogger,
            playing around with templates. I tried to use Wordpress but it was
            a little more complicated. I wanted to build sites and make my own
            templates from scratch and everything I would try to do
            independently would only half stick to my memory.</p>

            <p>Fast forward to being in Web Development 100 and I'm very happy
            with my decision. It has the right location, right near my office,
            the right of challenge and the class is the right size for me. I
            felt at ease with html and warmed up to the twists and turns of
            css. However, the terminal is taking a while for me to get
            comfortable using, with each homework assignment I seem to remember
            more and more the proper way to commit my changes and push them to
            <a href="https://github.com/alxbrmly" target="_blank">github</a>. I
            was freezing once I made directories or folders and then moved
            files, I would get frustrated, but git status is my friend and I'm
            remembering to commit using git commit -m "message here" (I believe
            that's correct, I didn't check my notes). I also remember that by
            default I'm always in the master branch so when I push my work to
            github I just need to use git push &lt; my GitHub repo url &gt;
            master.</p>

            <p>Long story short, some people, I won't name names, think I stay
            up too late now fiddling with the computer. Hey, I got the same
            amount of hours in my day as "insert any celebrity's name here" and
            I plan to use them wisely. I feel cooler every time I start grasp
            these somewhat strange and magical concepts.</p>
