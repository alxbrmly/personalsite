            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>I recently visited San Diego and other areas in the southern
            California region and loved it! The weather was fair, the people
            were friendly, and there were palm trees and cacti everywhere. I
            went to several beaches, so many I can't remember all their names,
            but who cares? I had fun! I did the tourist thing and visited
            Gaslamp in San Diego, Cabrillo monument, and Griffith Observatory
            right outside LA. The views were breath-taking.</p>

            <p>While in California, I was able to enjoy tons of delicious
            Mexican food! I ate veggie burritos almost everyday, actually every
            day. The burritos were huge and half the price of a burrito in NYC,
            and of course way more delicious. I also found vegan donuts in
            downtown San Deigo, and they were not only tasty, but large and
            still cheaper than those here in New York.</p>

            <p>I didn't buy much while in California, I mostly window shopped
            because I spent most of my time outdoors. I did manage to check out
            the <a href="http://theoutletsattheborder.com/" target=
            "_blank">Outlets at the Border</a> and they were okay. They're not
            as amazing as Woodbury Commons in New York. I think the outlet are
            for actual residents because the clothing definitely would not suit
            colder weather. The coolest part about these particular outlets is
            that they literally are across from the Mexican border.</p>
