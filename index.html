            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>I am currently the executive assistant to the President & CEO of
            a nonprofit in the Financial District. However, my background is
            totally unrelated to my current position. I have a <a href=
            "http://hunteruap.org/studios/where-will-new-yorkers-live-overhauling-new-york-citys-housing-policy/"
            target="_blank">Masters of Urban Planning</a> with a concentration
            in transportation planning. My undergrad degree is in psychology
            with a minor in history. It all sounds boring, right? It actually
            isn't! Then why aren't I working in planning or even psychology?
            Was I just not good at it? The job market can be tight when it
            comes to planning jobs and I am pretty good in my understanding of
            planning, I event know some basic GIS mapmaking. But really, the
            short answer is planning is quite a niche area, and I always wanted
            to work with computers, building websites, so here I am taking a
            Web Development Course at NYCDA. My goal is to become good enough
            to get a junior developer position by the end of the first half of 2016!</p>

            <h2 id="header">Interests / Likes</h2>

            <p>Well, if you got through the "about" section, then you can get
            through the more human description of what allows me to enjoy life.
            I like fonts, I had an extensive collection of fonts on my desktop
            growing up and I'm buildng a collection my new Mac. I am a
            self-proclaimed self-improvement literature junkie! I admire 1950s
            fashion and have a small collection of cateye glasses. Did I
            mention I also like cats? I blog on and off, have been since junior
            high, and miss the days of livejournal. Blogging has given me a
            basic relationship with html and css. Props to blogging! I also
            collect mini cacti and plants because I love their low maintenance
            factor. Did I mention, I'm vegan? Don't hate me!</p>
